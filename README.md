This repository contains notebooks for training, encoding in SBML and analyzing neural network models based on synthetic data of two case studies: Chassagnole and Park&Ramirez.
Chassagnole dataset is in the file Chass_simulation_data.xlsx, and Park&Ramirez dataset is in ParkRam_constant_feed.xlsx. Training notebooks for Chassagnole are in folders chass_training_ffnn_tanh, chass_training_ffnn_relu, chass_training_rnn_tanh, chass_training_rnn_relu (for different network topologies and activation functions) and when executed, these notebooks generate trained models and other training artifacts to the same folders. Analogousely, for Park&Ramirez training notebooks are four PR_training... folders. Training takes some time, so already trained models are in folders chass_best_models and pr_best_models.
